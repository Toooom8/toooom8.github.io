                        Sophia is Hanson Robotics’ latest and most advanced robot to date and a cultural icon. She has become a media darling, appearing on major media outlets around the world, igniting the interest of people regardless of age, gender, and culture, even gracing the cover of one of the top fashion magazines.  Her press coverage has a potential reach of over ten billion readers in 2017.

                        Sophia is a highly sought-after speaker in business and showed her prowess and great potential across many industries. She has met face-to-face with key decision makers in banking, insurance, auto manufacturing, property development, media, and entertainment. In addition, she has appeared onstage as a panel member and presenter in high-level conferences, covering how robotics and artificial intelligence will become a prevalent part of people’s lives. Her reputation extends beyond business into the global social arena. She was named the world’s first United Nation Innovation Champion by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and will have an official role in working with UNDP to promote sustainable development and safeguard human rights and equality.

                        Sophia is an evolving genius machine. Her incredible human likeness, expressiveness, and remarkable story as an awakening robot over time makes her a fascinating front-page technology story.

                        Sophia’s creator, Dr. David Hanson, is the founder of Hanson Robotics and a modern-day renaissance man who has built a worldwide reputation for creating robots that look and act amazingly human. After working at Disney as an “Imagineer,” Dr. Hanson aspired to create genius machines that will surpass human intelligence. Dr. Hanson believes that three distinctively human traits must be integrated into the artificial intelligence of these genius machines: Creativity, empathy, and compassion. As an extension of human intelligence, Hanson Robotics’ genius machines can evolve to solve world problems too complex for humans to solve themselves. Sophia personifies this bold and responsible goal.

                        Please follow Sophia’s journey to observe and engage with her as she develops into an exciting platform for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and service robotics applications in business, medical/healthcare, and education.

                        <h2>Hunter Kelly joins AYLIEN to take our engineering to the next level.</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        It’s an exciting time here at AYLIEN – in the past couple of months, we’ve moved office, closed a funding round, and added six people to the team. We’re delighted to announce our most recent hire and our first Chief Architect and Principal Engineer, Hunter Kelly. The AYLIEN tech infrastructure has grown to quite a scale at this point. In addition to serving over 30,000 users with three product offerings, we’re also a fully-functional AI research lab that houses five full-time researchers, who in turn feed their findings back into the products. With such a complex architecture and backends that have highly demanding tasks, bringing an engineer with the breadth and quality of experience that Hunter has is a huge boost to us as we move into the next phase of our journey.

                        At first glance, Hunter’s career has followed a seemingly meandering path through some really interesting companies. After graduating from UC Berkeley in the 90s, he joined the Photoscience Department at Pixar in California, became one of the first engineers in Google’s Dublin office, and at NewBay, he designed and built a multi-petabyte storage solution for handling user-generated content, still in use by some of the world’s largest telcos today. Hunter is joining us from Zalando’s Fashion Insight Centre, where as the first engineer in the Dublin office he kicked off the Fashion Content Platform, which was shortlisted as a finalist in the 2017 DatSci Awards.

                        The common thread in those roles, while perhaps not obvious, is data. Hunter brings this rich experience working on data, both from an engineering and data science perspective, to focus on one extremely important problem – how can we leverage data to solve our hardest problems?

                        This question is central to AI research, and Hunter’s expertise is a perfect fit with AYLIEN’s mission to make Natural Language Processing hassle-free for developers. Our APIs handle the heavy lifting so developers can leverage Deep NLP in a couple of lines of code, and the ease with which our users do this is down to the great work our science and engineering teams do. Adding Hunter to the intersection of these teams will add a huge amount to our capabilities here and we’re really excited about the great work we can get done.

                        Here’s what Hunter had to say about joining the team:

                        “I’m really excited to be joining AYLIEN at this point in time. I think that AI and Machine Learning are incredibly powerful tools that everyone should be able to leverage. I really look forward to being able to bring my expertise and experience, particularly with large-scale and streaming data platforms, to AYLIEN to help broaden their already impressive offerings. AI is just reaching that critical point of moving beyond academia and reaching wide-scale adoption. Making its power accessible to the wider community beyond very focused experts is a really interesting and exciting challenge.”

                        When he’s not in AYLIEN, Hunter can be found spending time with his wife and foster children, messing around learning yet another programming language, painting minis, playing board games, tabletop RPG’s and wargames, or spending too much time playing video games.  He’s also been known to do some Salsa dancing, traveling, sailing, and scuba diving.
